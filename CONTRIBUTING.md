## About This Project

lucide note is a multi-tenant notes application built with Next.js, featuring role-based access control and subscription management. It's designed as a learning project and proof-of-concept.

**Important Notes:**

- This is not production-ready software
- Not intended for commercial use
- Use for learning and experimentation only

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** - Required runtime
- **pnpm** - Package manager
- **PostgreSQL** - Database (local or hosted like Supabase/Neon)
- **Git** - Version control

### Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lucide-note.git
   cd lucide-note
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   cp .env.example .env  # If example exists, otherwise create manually
   ```

   Add the following to `.env`:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/lucide-note"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-nextauth-secret-here"
   ```

4. **Set Up Database**

   ```bash
   # Run migrations
   pnpm db:migrate

   # Seed with test data
   pnpm db:seed
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Test Accounts

For testing, use these pre-seeded accounts (password: `password`):

**Acme Tenant:**

- `admin@acme.test` (Admin)
- `user@acme.test` (Member)

**Globex Tenant:**

- `admin@globex.test` (Admin)
- `user@globex.test` (Member)

## Development Workflow

### Development Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **EditorConfig**: Maintains consistent coding styles across editors
- **Husky**: Git hooks for automated checks
- **lint-staged**: Run linters on staged files only
- **Commitlint**: Enforce conventional commit messages
- **Commitizen**: Interactive commit prompts
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **ESLint**: Code linting

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev              # Start development server
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm lint             # Run linting
pnpm typecheck        # Run TypeScript type checking

# Testing
pnpm test             # Run all tests
pnpm test:unit        # Run unit tests
pnpm test:integration # Run integration tests
pnpm test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode

# Database
pnpm db:generate      # Generate Prisma client
pnpm db:migrate       # Run database migrations
pnpm db:seed          # Seed database with test data

# Git & Commits
pnpm commit           # Interactive commit with conventional format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The following checks run automatically when you commit:

1. **lint-staged**: Formats and lints only staged files
2. **commitlint**: Validates commit message format

## Code Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the existing component structure
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

### Database & API

- All database queries must include tenant isolation
- Use Prisma's type-safe queries
- Validate input data on API endpoints
- Return consistent error responses
- Document API endpoints in the README

### File Organization

## Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

```text
<type>/<description>
```

Examples:

```text
feat/add-user-authentication
fix/login-validation-bug
docs/update-api-documentation
refactor/cleanup-components
```

### Commit Messages

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format:**

```text
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `revert`: Reverting changes

**Examples:**

```bash
feat(auth): add NextAuth session validation
fix(ui): resolve mobile layout issues
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(components): simplify note editor logic
```

**Interactive Commits:**

```bash
pnpm commit
```

This provides an interactive prompt to create properly formatted commits.
